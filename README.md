# Hands-on Lab: Exploring Watsonx Code Assistant with Python and GoLang

## Objective
In this lab, you'll explore the capabilities of IBM Watsonx Code Assistant for generating, explaining, and improving code. You’ll choose one language—**Python** or **GoLang**—and work through the commands provided in the instructions to see how Watsonx Code Assistant can help with common programming tasks.

## Getting Started

1. **Choose Your Language**:
   - Decide if you want to work with **Python** or **GoLang**.
   - In the file structure, find the corresponding folder for your chosen language (either `/python` or `/golang`).
   - The folder contains two files: `bad.py` (or `bad.go`) and `sample.py` (or `sample.go`), which you will use for this lab.

2. **Try Out Each Instruction with Watsonx Code Assistant**:
   - Follow the `Readme.md` in each of the folder (Choose only one)
